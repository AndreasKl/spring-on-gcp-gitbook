# Vulnerability Scanning

[Cloud Container Analysis](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/container-analysis) can scan your container images stored in Container Registry for vulnerabilities. See [Vulnerability Scanning documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/vulnerability-scanning) for more detail.

## Enable API

```bash
gcloud services enable containeranalysis.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable containerscanning.googleapis.com
```

## Vulnerabilities

Container images are scanned upon push to Container Registry, and then continuously monitoried/scanned if the image was pulled in the last 30 days.

You can see the status of Vulnerability Scanning in the browser for the container image:

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)

open https://gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/helloworld
```

Or, list vulnerabilities for a specific container image:

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)

gcloud beta container images describe gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/helloworld \
  --show-package-vulnerability
```
