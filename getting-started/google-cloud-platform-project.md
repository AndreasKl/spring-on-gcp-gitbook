# Google Cloud Platform

## Sign Up

If you don't already use [Google Cloud Platform](http://cloud.google.com/), sign up for an account and [get started for free](http://cloud.google.com/freetrial), and receive $300 credit for the first 12 months.

## Project

All cloud services and resources \(such as virtual machines, network, load balancer, etc\) are to be created under a Google Cloud Platform project.

A project is a billing unit. Any services / resources you create under the project will be charged to the Billing Account associated with the project.

A project is  a security boundary. You can assign additional users to access different services / resources within the project.

Project is usually referred by Project ID. A Project ID is globally unique.

### New Account

If this is your first time signing up for Google Cloud Platform, it will automatically create a Google Cloud Platform Project.
