# Introduction

This is a community documentation that captures everything [Ray Tsang \(@saturnism\)](https://twitter.com/saturnism) knows to running Spring Boot microservices/applications on Google Cloud Platform. 

Instead of writing individual blogs on each topic, the content is organized and intended to be kept up to date. Feel free to [contribute via GitHub](https://github.com/saturnism/spring-on-gcp-gitbook), and/or [file topic requests](https://github.com/saturnism/spring-on-gcp-gitbook/issues)!

{% hint style="info" %}
This is not official Google Cloud documentation. Always refer to official documentation for current pricing, features, limitations, etc.
